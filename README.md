Here's assigment for full stack dev at Primephonic.
So as I discussed with my recruter - assigment would take up to 2 hours.
And so I've not tried to make some endless epic project and made simple stuff that works so to avoid overcoding.

I used VUE cli and EXPRESS cli to create backbone of project.
Also because project is small - I don't see point of splitting server and client and spliting main VUE component due to it will result in lesser readability
