# test

# Hi there, Primephonic :)

Quick start

1. **get dependencies**
```npm i```
or
```yarn install```
2. ***build frontend***
```npm run build ```
3. ***start server***
```npm run start```
4. ***in browser go to*** 
```http://localhost:3000```

Here's assignment for full stack dev at Primephonic.
My recruiter told me that assignment would take around 2 hours - so I've not tried to make some endless epic project and made simple stuff that works so to avoid overcoding.

I used ```Vue cli``` and ```Express cli``` to create backbone of project.
Also because project is small - I don't see point in splitting server and client and splitting main Vue component due to - it will result in lesser readability.

Data is stored in data file and interacted with through dataStore module

Tested on: Ubuntu 18.10, Node 10.13.0, npm 6.8.0, yarn 1.12.3
